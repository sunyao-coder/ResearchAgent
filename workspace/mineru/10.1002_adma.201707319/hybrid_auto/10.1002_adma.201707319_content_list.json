It should be noted that the increased hydrophilicity after oxidation may have also contributed to the high EASA. As shown in Figure 2c, LIG-O has a much higher jEASA than that of LIG and LIG-A, indicating that the oxidation not only increased the EASA of LIG, but also created more active sites; both contributed to the high activity.

As shown in Figures S13 and S14 (Supporting Information), the edge sites on graphene that are adjacent to $\\mathrm { C } { = } \\mathrm { O }$ were taken into consideration to determine the change of Gibbs free energy which represents the thermodynamic barriers during OER. In the four-electron OER process, the step with maximum Gibbs free energy change $( \\Delta G _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } )$ is recognized as the thermodynamics-limiting step as shown in Figure S13e (Supporting Information). For the oxygenfree edges, the $\\Delta G _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ are higher than 1.27 eV (Table S4, Supporting Information), which indicates a very high overpotential for OER. On the contrary, a low $\\Delta G _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of $0 . 4 9 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ was found for the oxygen-containing edges (hex-O-C). The LIG-O has abundant edges as revealed by the TEM and EASA analyses, and thus has more active sites in good contact with the electrolyte. The $\\mathrm { C } { = } \\mathrm { O }$ moieties on or near the five/seven-membered rings may also activate their neighboring carbon atoms to have higher OER activity, since the distorted electron clouds around the five/ seven-membered rings would be more easily affected. An abundance of five/seven-membered rings are present in LIG since it forms through a rapid cooling in the lasing process, making it kinetic graphene-like.[13a] For instance, the $\\Delta G _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ of a pentagonal site is $0 . 7 2 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ and thus these sites may be catalyzing OER as the overpotential increases (pen-O-C in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). These calculations show that the oxygen defects may indeed significantly enhance the OER performance of graphene edges by lowering the $\\Delta G _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ on adjacent carbons. ",

Despite the similar overpotential in the discharge process, LIG-O showed a remarkably lowered overpotential of $0 . 6 3 \\mathrm { ~ V } ,$ which was much lower than the overpotential of 1.01 V from the pristine LIG. Additionally, LIG-O showed cycle stability superior to that of LIG and commercial Pt/C as depicted in Figure S23 (Supporting Information).

The decomposition of $\\mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ at lower potential is of great importance for improving the roundtrip efficiency of batteries. A demonstration of the LIG-O $\\mathrm { L i } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ battery is presented in Figure S23d (Supporting Information), where a light-emitting diode (LED) (NTE30105, 2.8 V, 25 mA) was lit by one cell. Due to the high activity of LIG-O, it is probable that the performance of LIG-O could be further improved by optimization for practical utilization. ",

        "text": "In summary, we prepared oxidized LIG-O as an efficient catalyst for oxygen electrocatalysis. The oxidation of LIG with intrinsic high surface area produces abundant active sites for electrocatalysis, leading to the excellent OER/ORR activity. Additionally, the LIG-O is particularly advantageous for the $\\mathrm { L i } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 2 }$ decomposition that can dramatically lower the overpotential of the charging process by $\\approx 3 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V } .$ The outstanding OER performance of LIG-O is rationalized by the oxygen-containing groups (e.g., $\\mathrm { C } { = } \\mathrm { O }$ ) that enhance the adsorption of OER intermediates and facilitate the rate-determining step. Benefiting from its high performance with low cost and facile preparation, LIG-O is a promising alternative to metal-based catalysts for water splitting, metal–air $^ { \\prime } { \\bf O } _ { 2 }$ batteries, and many other applications. Our findings lead to a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of LIG-derived materials as well as further improvements in the catalytic activity of surface-oxidized carbon nanomaterials. ",
