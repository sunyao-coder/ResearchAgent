Here, a novel MOF-hybrid-assisted strategy to synthesize ${ \\mathsf { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathsf { O } } _ { 4 } / { \\mathsf { C o } }$ -Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes is reported. In the first step, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67, a Co-based MOF)/Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) yolk–shell nanocubes are formed via a facile anion-exchange reaction between ZIF-67 nanocube precursors and $[ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - }$ ions at room temperature. Subsequently, an annealing treatment is applied to prepare ${ \\mathsf { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathsf { O } } _ { 4 } / { \\mathsf { C o } }$ -Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes. Owing to the structural and compositional benefits, the as-derived ${ \\mathsf { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathsf { O } } _ { 4 } / { \\mathsf { C o } }$ -Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution.

Construction of complex MOF composite by efficiently integrating two or more MOFs as coprecursors is highly favorable for the synthesis of desirable functional materials. Ion-exchange is an effective approach for structural and compositional transformation of nanomaterials.[44–46] Due to the instinct chemical instability of many MOFs, controllable conversion of simple MOF crystals to complex nanostructured MOF hybrid precursors through ionexchange reactions is highly beneficial for constructing complicated MOF-derived nanomaterials in terms of both architecture and chemical composition.

The surface becomes rough, while small cubic subunits are found on the surface (Figure S11a,b, Supporting Information).

The low-magnification FESEM image verifies the as-derived particles preserve the cubic morphology with rough surface (Figure 3a). A shell-in-shell structure can be discerned from the broken particles (Figure 3b). As further elucidated by TEM characterization, double-shelled structures can be clearly observed (Figure 3c–e). The smaller inner boxes derived from ZIF-67 cores are produced during the thermal treatment in air. As revealed by elemental mapping analysis (Figure 3f), Fe, Co, and O elements are evenly distributed in the outer shell, while only Co and O elements could be found in the inner box of the product. These results indicate firmly the formation of $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o { - F e } }$ oxide DSNBs.

The $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide DSNBs exhibit the lowest onset potential among the three samples and require overpotential of ${ \\approx } 2 9 7 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ to reach a current density of $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m A \\ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ . Co-Fe oxide and $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ SSNBs deliver the current density of $1 0 \\mathrm { \\ m A \\ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ at overpotentials of ${ \\approx } 3 4 0$ and ${ \\approx } 3 9 4 ~ \\mathrm { m V } ,$ respectively. The electrocatalytic performance of $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o { - F e } }$ oxide DSNBs is comparable to that of many Co-based catalysts reported previously (Table S1, Supporting Information). The electrochemical double-layer capacitance $( C _ { \\mathrm { d l } } )$ , which is proportional to the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), is further determined by measuring the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves in the potential range of 1.177–1.277 V without redox processes. Compared with both Co-Fe oxide and ${ \\mathrm { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 4 }$ SSNBs, the $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide DSNBs exhibit much higher $C _ { \\mathrm { d l } }$ (Figure S20, Supporting Information). The enhanced ECSA might come from extra active sites on inner ${ \\mathrm { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 4 }$ shells of $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o - F e }$ oxide DSNBs. Moreover, Tafel plots of the three samples are also calculated from the LSV curves to examine the kinetics of their OER performances. With the data shown in Figure 4b, the linear regions of the Tafel plots are fitted to the Tafel equation $( \\eta = b \\times \\log j + a$ , where $\\eta$ is the overpotential, $j$ is the current density, and $b$ is the Tafel slope). The Tafel slope of $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide DSNBs $( 6 1 ~ \\mathrm { m V } ~ \\mathrm { d e c ^ { - 1 } } )$ is smaller than that of Co-Fe oxide SSNBs $( 7 2 \\mathrm { m V } \\mathrm { d e c } ^ { - 1 } )$ and ${ \\mathrm { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 4 }$ SSNBs (66 mV dec−1 ).

In addition, a chronoamperometry test of $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide DSNBs is conducted at the overpotential of $3 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ to study the catalytic stability as shown in Figure 4c.

Similar to the Ni-Fe-based catalyst,[50] the introduction of Fe element into cobalt oxide might significantly enhance the conductivity of the double-shelled particles, which is favorable for the OER performance. In addition, the double-shelled nanostructure can not only provide rich active centers but also increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area, contributing to high catalytic activity. ",

Starting from ZIF-67 nanocubes, complex ZIF-67/Co-Fe PBA yolk–shell nanocubes are prepared through an anion-exchange reaction between ZIF-67 nanocubes and $\\mathrm { [ F e ( C N ) _ { 6 } ] ^ { 3 - } }$ ions. $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide doubleshelled nanoboxes are obtained by a subsequent annealing treatment. With their structural and compositional advantages, the $\\mathrm { C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 } / C o }$ -Fe oxide double-shelled nanoboxes show enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER compared with Co-Fe oxide and ${ \\mathrm { C o } } _ { 3 } { \\mathrm { O } } _ { 4 }$ single-shelled nanoboxes. The developed approach may inspire further capability on constructing complex hollow-structured materials for a variety of energy related applications. ",
