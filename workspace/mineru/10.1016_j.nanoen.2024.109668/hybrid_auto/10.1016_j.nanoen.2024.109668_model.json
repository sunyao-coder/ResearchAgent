However, the modulation effect using only single coordination regulation is often insufficient to optimize the electronic and geometric structure of metal active centers. Herein, a general strategy to modify the activity of single-atomic Fe site is achieved by dual decoration of Fe centers with contiguous sulfur atoms and metal nanoclusters via an aggregation-redispersion route. Under near-range engagement, the adjacent S atoms and Fe nanoclusters can break the symmetric electronic interface of Fe-N moiety, and act as the modulators to synergistically tune the electronic configurations of Fe centers, leading to less electron transfer to \\(*\\mathrm{OH}\\), and subsequent favorable desorption. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical results reinforces the significant roles of S atoms and metal clusters in tandem by correlating their induced electron redistribution with ORR activity, which ultimately accelerates the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates for robust catalytic performance. Due to the improvement of graphitization degree, carbon supports possess efficient active sites and exhibit superior anti-corrosion. The resultant FeNC-2 M demonstrates outstanding ORR activity with high power density, maintaining remarkable durability in Zn-air batteries and microbial fuel cells. This work provides effective and universal way to modulate microenvironment of single metal sites, facilitating the open up of potential application spaces for various SACs."

So far, carbon supported single-atom catalysts (SACs), which are composed of isolated metal-nitrogen coordinated active sites anchored on carbon matrixes (M-N-C, M=Fe, Co, Mn, Cu etc.), exhibit outstanding ORR performance due to maximum atomic utilization efficiency and controllable metal coordination environment [6,7].

Recently, coupling \\(\\mathrm{M - N_x}\\) site with other adjacent metal centers or metallic nanoclusters also have been demonstrated as a feasible strategy to expedite the electrocatalytic activity of M-N-C catalyst [25-27]. Present-day achievements indicate that the heteronuclear coordination can modify the \\(d\\) states of the metal atom, resulting in the optimized adsorption/desorption feature, owing to the synergy between the dual-nuclear metal pairs and the asymmetrical electron distribution around the binuclear metal centers [28-30]. As such, the multinuclear sites, particularly atomic clusters, are highly effective in adjusting the single-atom intrinsic catalytic activity [31,32]. Elaborately controlling nanocluster qualities (such as spatial distribution [33], particle size [26] and composition [34,35]) can induce the electron redistribution of metal atom to narrow the potential barriers of the rate-limiting steps for ORR, resulting in an improved catalytic behavior. However, due to the well-documented thermodynamic instability, metal nanoclusters are prone to grow into larger crystallites during pyrolysis, attributing to the rapidly increased surface energy with the diminution of particle size [13,36]. Additionally, a specific single coordination regulation strategy is often not sufficient to perfectly optimize the electronic and geometric structure of \\(\\mathrm{M - N_4}\\) center.

However, as displayed in Fig. S6, there was a certain amount of Fe nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon layers in FeNC-2 M-0.5 H, which was consistent with XRD measurement, indicating that low concentration of acid was insufficient to decompose the iron species, leading to serious Fe agglomeration. In addition, the AC-HAADF-STEM image (Fig. S4b, c) of FeNC-2 M-2 H catalyst was analogous to the that of FeNC-2 M catalyst, except for a slight reduction in the density of Fe clusters, indicating the stability of iron species and the repeatability of this structure. In summary, thiosemicarbazide and Fe ion could coordinate to form the compound containing cyano species, which were carbonized to generate Prussian blue anchored porous carbon. The content and crystallinity of Prussian blue could be effectively controlled by adjusting the amount of Mg-based template and the concentration of \\(\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{SO}_4\\) during pickling. After secondary carbonization, the Prussian blue group would decompose and redisperse on the heteroatom-doped carbon materials. A small amount of Prussian blue would form monodispersed Fe sites or tiny clusters, and when the Prussian blue loading is high, metal Fe or FeS particles would be formed."

The XPS survey spectra (Fig. S7a) portrayed the existence of C, N, O, S, and Fe in all three catalysts, and corresponding elements content were presented in Table S2. The content of N was determined to be 5.36 at \\(\\%\\) for FeNC-2 M, which was higher than those of FeNC-1 M (3.82 at \\(\\%\\)) and FeNC-3 M (1.54 at \\(\\%\\)), suggesting that proper amount of MgO and KCl templates significantly promoted the content of N, due to their catalysis and decomposition on the carbon materials. The high-resolution N 1 s XPS spectra (Fig. 2b) displayed the existence of five types of N species, including pyridinic N (\\(\\sim 398.2\\mathrm{eV}\\)), Fe-N (\\(\\sim 399.2\\mathrm{eV}\\)), pyrrolic N (\\(\\sim 400.5\\mathrm{eV}\\)), graphitic N (\\(\\sim 401.6\\mathrm{eV}\\)), and oxidized N (\\(\\sim 404.6\\mathrm{eV}\\))[38]. The relative ratios and atomic contents of N species calculated according to the integrated peak areas were displayed in Fig. S7c and Fig. S7d. Specifically, the fitting parameters suggested that the pyridinic N and graphitic N were predominant in all catalysts, and their atomic content in FeNC-2 M was the highest, reaching 1.35 and 1.49 at \\(\\%\\), respectively. These N species were beneficial to significantly promoting the catalytic activity for ORR. The high-resolution S 2p spectra (Fig. 2c) of FeNC-\\(n\\mathrm{M}\\) showed two peaks located at about 164.1 and \\(165.3\\mathrm{eV}\\) assigning to S \\(2p_{3/2}\\) and S \\(2p_{1/2}\\) peaks of S species (thiophene-like S), and another peak at around \\(168.5\\mathrm{eV}\\) belonging to oxidized S. Notable differences were observed in the S 2p spectra of FeNC-3 M with two obvious peaks at \\(\\sim 161.5\\) and \\(\\sim 162.9\\mathrm{eV}\\), corresponding to \\(S_{\\mathrm{n}}^{2-}\\) and \\(S^{2-}\\) species. This was attributed to the formation of metal sulfide, consistent with the observation from XRD results (Fig. 2a). The total S content (Table S2) of FeNC-\\(n\\mathrm{M}\\) exhibited a tendency to decrease with the rising of templates dosage, while the Fe content increased. It is notable that FeNC-2 M exhibited the highest atomic content of oxidized S of \\(0.30\\mathrm{wt\\%}\\) among all catalysts, occupying \\(46.6\\%\\) of total S content (Fig. S7c and Fig. S7d). These sulfur-dopants, especially the oxidized S, can contribute to the redistribution of surface electron on Fe-N sites, thus facilitating their interaction with oxygenated species and then enhancing the ORR kinetics[14,39].

The calculated \\(I_{\\mathrm{D}} / I_{\\mathrm{G}}\\) value of FeNC-2 M is 1.10, slightly higher than that of FeNC-1 M (1.06) and FeNC-3 M (1.07), illustrating that the moderate template content can promote the formation of more defect sites due to the decomposition/recombination of C/N/S sources under the catalysis of in situ MgO and KCl template. Besides, split twin peaks at about 2683 and \\(2938~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\) for FeNC-3 M (Fig. 2d) corresponded to 2D band and \\(\\mathrm{D + D'}\\) band[43], which was the typical symbol of graphitic carbon.

For comparison, analyses were also performed on the corresponding reference catalysts, such as Fe-foil, \\(\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}\\), iron phthalocyanine (FePc), and \\(\\mathrm{FeS}_2\\). The Fe K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3a) showed the edge position of FeNC-2 M was between \\(\\mathrm{FeS}_2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}\\), demonstrating the average valence state of Fe was between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states and close to Fe(II) state. The Fourier transform (FT) EXAFS spectra of FeNC-2 M and the references were illustrated in Fig. 3b. The FeNC-2 M exhibited a prominent FT peak at about \\(1.4\\AA\\), which was mainly attributed to the Fe-N/O first coordination shell and close to that in the reference FePc (\\(\\sim1.5\\AA\\)). Furthermore, there were a small shoulder peak at \\(1.85\\AA\\) and an obvious peak at \\(2.3\\AA\\), arising from Fe-S and Fe-Fe scattering paths, respectively, and revealing the co-existence of Fe-N(O/S)\\(_x\\) species and metallic Fe[20,26, 31]. Wavelet transform (WT) also was applied to discriminate the backscattering atoms, owing to the powerful resolution in both \\(k\\) and \\(R\\) spaces. As shown in Fig. 3c, WT analysis of FeNC-2 M revealed an intensity maximum at low k value (\\(\\sim3.3\\AA^{-1}\\)). Besides, distinct from those (Fig. S8a) of \\(\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}\\) (\\(\\sim7.5\\AA^{-1}\\)) and Fe-foil (\\(\\sim7.6\\AA^{-1}\\)), the contour plots of FeNC-2 M showed an additional smaller peak at high k value (\\(\\sim7\\AA^{-1}\\)) as a ridge that could be assigned to Fe-Fe scattering. Taking into account the results presented in XRD and HAADF-STEM studies, it can be assumed that Fe in FeNC-2 M existed primarily as highly monodispersed atoms, but also as many tiny nanoclusters. Quantitatively, the structural parameters at Fe K-edge were extracted by a least-square EXAFS fitting in \\(R\\), \\(q\\), and \\(k\\) spaces. Based on the results (Fig. 3d, e, Fig. S8c, and Table S3), the first coordination shell around Fe for FeNC-2 M was constructed (the inset of Fig. 3d). It demonstrated the presence of both Fe-N and Fe-S, with coordination numbers of 3 and 1, respectively. Their respective mean bond length were 1.94 and \\(2.33\\AA\\), close to the fitting result of FePc and the theoretical value of \\(\\mathrm{FeS}_2\\), further evidencing the Fe-\\(\\mathrm{N}_3\\mathrm{S}\\) coordination structure in this catalyst. Meanwhile, there also existed an absorbed O atom on the axial direction of Fe-\\(\\mathrm{N}_3\\mathrm{S}\\) plane. The oxygen may be adsorbed in the form of \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\), due to the exposure of the catalyst to air. Moreover, a small contribution from the Fe-Fe scattering path relative to Fe nanoclusters was determined, illustrating that minimum amount of Fe species were present in metallic clusters form. For comparison, the first shell of Fe center in FePc (Fig. S8b, d) exhibited a coordination number of four, directly connected by four N atoms. According to the EXAFS fitting and TEM results, the Fe atoms coordinated with three N atoms and one S atom, and the \\(\\mathrm{Fe - N_3S}\\) species were anchored in N-doped carbon with Fe nanoclusters."

The corresponding Tafel slope (Fig. 4b) of FeNC-2 M was determined to be \\(49\\mathrm{mVdec}^{-1}\\), which was greatly lower than that of other catalysts \\((55\\mathrm{mVdec}^{-1}\\) for FeNC-1 M, \\(63\\mathrm{mVdec}^{-1}\\) for FeNC-3 M, and \\(78\\mathrm{mVdec}^{-1}\\) for Pt/C), indicating the fast kinetics for FeNC-2 M. Furthermore, compared with the performance of catalysts treated with different acid concentration, the ORR activity of FeNC-2 M showed obvious advantages over FeNC-2 M-0.25 H and FeNC-2 M-0.5 H catalysts (Fig. 4c, d), indicating the important role of \\(\\mathrm{Fe - N_3S}\\) sites"

Numerous studies[20,46-48] have indicated that the \\(\\mathrm{FeN_4}\\) site is located at the left side of the Volcano plot, and its strong adsorption, in turn, leads to the difficult desorption of ORR intermediates from the active center and thus a slower ORR kinetics (Fig. 5b).

When hydroxyl ligand adsorbed on one side of the \\(\\mathrm{Fe_4}\\) cluster, the \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\)-OH-up model (Fig. S18a) was constructed. Its RDS (Fig. S19) turned to be the third electron-transfer step, i.e., the formation of \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{OH}\\) from the protonation of \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{O}\\) (Fig. S20b, c), having a bigger overpotential \\((\\eta)\\) of \\(0.685\\mathrm{V}\\) compared with \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\) model (Fig. S19). The proposed mechanisms of ORR on \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\) (Pathway 1) and \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\)-OH-up models (Pathway 2) were depicted in Fig. 5c, S21 and S22, which belonged to the indirect four-electron processes. When hydroxyl ligand adsorbed on the opposite side of the \\(\\mathrm{Fe_4}\\) cluster, namely, \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\)-OH-down model (Fig. S18b), its adsorbed \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{OOH}\\) was decomposed directly to \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{O}\\) and \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{OH}\\), that is, \\(\\mathrm{OOH}^* \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O}^* + \\mathrm{OH}^*\\) (Fig. S19 and S20d) and direct four-electron processes may occur (Pathway 3, Fig. S23), due to the lower barrier of \\(\\mathrm{O}_2\\) dissociation. However, the subsequent \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{OH}\\) desorption \\((\\mathrm{O}^* + \\mathrm{OH}^* + 3\\) \\((\\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{e}^{-}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O}^* + \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + 2(\\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{e}^-)\\), corresponding to step (2)) needed an endothermic reaction energy of \\(0.879\\mathrm{eV}\\), even at \\(\\mathrm{U} = 0\\mathrm{V}\\), resulting in a high overpotential. The mechanism of ORR on \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\) model with or without \\({}^{*}\\mathrm{OH}\\) is summarized in Fig. 5c. The ORR mechanism on \\(\\mathrm{FeN}_3\\mathrm{S - Fe_4}\\) model could only follow an indirect four-electron processes.

Due to the near-range interaction, the ambient S atoms and Fe nanoclusters could rationally control the unsymmetrical interface structure of central Fe atoms, resulting in a unique electron configuration. DFT computations disclosed that the synergistic effect of heteroatom and clusters can adequately tune the electronic configurations of single-atom Fe in FeNC-2 M, thus accelerating the desorption of OH* as the RDS and lowering the reaction energy barrier. The dynamic progress of ORR verified the improved reaction kinetics. Benefiting from high activity and accessibility of metal sites, as well as its admirable anticorrosion capability triggered by the graphitized carbon support, the optimal FeNC-2 M catalyst displayed impressive ORR activity and superior durability in wide pH range. Furthermore, FeNC-2 M-based ZABs and MFCs demonstrated a substantial improvement of catalytic performance compared to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, especially in the cycling stability, elucidating the promising perspective for practical applications.
