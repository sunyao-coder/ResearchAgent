        "text": "Visible-light-driven conversion of $\\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ into chemical fuels is an intriguing approach to address the energy and environmental challenges. In principle, light harvesting and catalytic reactions can be both optimized by combining the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts; however, the efficiency of charge transfer between light absorbers and catalytic sites is often too low to limit the overall photocatalytic performance. In this communication, it is reported that the single-atom Co sites coordinated on the partially oxidized graphene nanosheets can serve as a highly active and durable heterogeneous catalyst for $\\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ conversion, wherein the graphene bridges homogeneous light absorbers with single-atom catalytic sites for the efficient transfer of photoexcited electrons. As a result, the turnover number for CO production reaches a high value of 678 with an unprecedented turnover frequency of $3 . 7 7 \\mathrm { \\ m i n ^ { - 1 } }$ , superior to those obtained with the state-of-theart heterogeneous photocatalysts. This work provides fresh insights into the design of catalytic sites toward photocatalytic $\\mathbf { C O } _ { 2 }$ conversion from the angle of single-atom catalysis and highlights the role of charge kinetics in bridging the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysts.

In the single-atom catalysts, the individual and isolated metal atoms anchored on supports can be regarded as homogeneous catalyst analogs when the supports serve as rigid ligands from the viewpoint of coordination chemistry.[3b] This similarity offers the following advantages as compared with their nanocluster, nanoparticle, and bulk counterparts: (i) an unexpectedly high activity and selectivity by their unsaturated coordination sites and tunable electronic structures; (ii) a significant reduction in catalytic metal usage by maximizing the number of catalytic sites; and (iii) well-defined active sites for mechanistic studies.

To fully exploit the activity of single-atom Co sites for photocatalytic $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reduction, two key factors should be considered—the transfer of photoexcited electrons from light absorbers to catalytic Co sites that modulates the efficiency of entire photocatalytic system[3d] and the metal–support interactions that stabilize single metal atoms as well as alter their charge states.[9] Thus, the supports that bridge catalytic sites and light absorbers hold the key to achieving high photocatalytic performance. An ideal support should possess the following features: (i) specific anchoring sites to tightly “grasp” the single atoms; (ii) large surface area and flexible surface to allow the high loading of catalytic sites; and (iii) high carrier mobility to facilitate the photoexcited electron transfer.

The white-line peak for $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ at about 7727 eV is higher than that of Co foil but lower than that of CoO, indicating that the Co in $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ possesses an electronic structure between those of CoO and Co foil. This observation suggests that Co atoms are positively charged through the charge transfer from Co to graphene, originating from the metal–support interactions. Processed through a Fourier transform (FT), the Co extended XAFS (EXAFS) spectra (Figure 2b) are obtained to determine the local structures of the single Co atoms. In reference to standard Co foil and CoO, the $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ sample does not present the peak for $\\mathrm { C o } { - } \\mathrm { C o }$ bond, suggesting the absence of Co-derived metallic Co or CoO clusters/ particles. These results confirm that the Co species are isolated and dispersed single atoms. Meanwhile, the peak at about $1 . 4 \\mathring \\mathrm { A }$ for $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ in EXAFS spectra indicates that the single Co atoms are coordinated with O or/and C atoms.

As a matter of fact, we have ruled out the cases that the Co center atom is coordinated only with O atoms $( \\mathrm { C o O } _ { 4 } )$ or with C atoms $( \\mathrm { C o C _ { 4 } } )$ since the fitting results cannot reproduce the experimental spectrum well (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

In order to evaluate the catalytic performance of single-atom Co sites at $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets, we choose a typical visible-light photosensitizer $[ \\mathrm { R u ( b p y ) } _ { 3 } ] \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ as the light absorber and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial agent for photoexcited holes, which are commonly used in the homogeneous catalyst systems for photocatalytic $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reduction. Figure 3a summarizes the catalytic performance by our $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets in reference to control samples. Our $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ catalyst (the last column in Figure 3a) achieves a TON of 374 and a TOF (turnover frequency) of $2 . 0 8 \\ \\mathrm { m i n } ^ { - 1 }$ for CO production in the first $^ { 3 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ , with a selectivity of $7 9 . 4 \\%$ over competing $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ generation. Note that the synthesis gas products with a $\\mathrm { C O } /$ $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ ratio between 0.5 and 1 are the desired gas sources for the thermochemical synthesis of methanol and Fischer–Tropsch reactions in the existing industrial processes,[13] suggesting the potential applications of our products. The CO product is continuously generated in the initial $^ { 3 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ , but the yield rate gradually decreases as the reaction proceeds upon irradiation (Figure S5a, Supporting Information). This stagnation effect is attributed to the degradation of $[ \\mathrm { R u ( b p y ) } _ { 3 } ] \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ photosensitizer that has been reported in previous photocatalysis studies.[14] Encouragingly, the maximal TON of CO production can reach 678 (TOF, $3 . 7 7 ~ \\mathrm { { m i n ^ { - 1 } } }$ ) through altering the ratio of $[ \\mathrm { R u ( b p y ) } _ { 3 } ]$ $\\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ to $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets (Figure S5b, Supporting Information), which is obviously higher than those of the state-of-theart heterogeneous photocatalysts for $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reduction in literature (Table S1, Supporting Information). This indicates that the number of photoexcited electrons supplied to catalytic Co sites holds the key to the overall photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, no liquid hydrocarbon products derived from $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ such as $\\mathrm { C H } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { O H }$ , HCHO, and HCOOH can be detected through analyzing the solvent after photocatalytic reactions by gas chromatograph and $^ 1 \\mathrm { H }$ -NMR spectroscopy (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Although graphene does not provide active sites for $\\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ reduction, it plays a key role in promoting the transfer of photoexcited electrons.

As indicated by UV–vis–IR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy characterization (Figure S12a, Supporting Information), the $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets do not show an absorption edge, indicating that they are a class of zero-bandgap materials— a typical feature for graphene.[19] This result indicates that the coordination of single Co atoms with graphene does not alter the band structure of graphene. The zero-bandgap feature of $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets is further evidenced by synchrotron-radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) spectroscopy. The valenceband (VB) spectrum (Figure S12b, Supporting Information) shows that the energy difference between the VB edge and the Fermi level $( E _ { \\mathrm { F } } )$ is nearly zero. Meanwhile, the work function $( \\varphi )$ of $\\mathrm { C o } _ { 1 } – \\mathrm { G }$ nanosheets can be calculated to be $4 . 9 0 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ from the secondary electron cutoff $( E _ { \\mathrm { c u t o f f } } )$ Figure S12c, Supporting Information) in the SRPES. In other words, the Fermi level is $4 . 9 0 \\mathrm { e V }$ relative to the vacuum level. Meanwhile, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of $[ \\mathrm { R u ( b p y ) } _ { 3 } ] \\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ with respect to the vacuum level have been determined as 5.68 and $3 . 1 9 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ in previous work, respectively.[20] Given the energy level diagram ",
