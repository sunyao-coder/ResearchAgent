In terms of catalytic reactions, the heterogeneous single-atom catalysts that were first demonstrated in 2011[6] have recently sparked tremendous interest in various catalytic reactions[7] as they can bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. In the single-atom catalysts, the individual and isolated metal atoms anchored on supports can be regarded as homogeneous catalyst analogs when the supports serve as rigid ligands from the viewpoint of coordination chemistry.[3b] This similarity offers the following advantages as compared with their nanocluster, nanoparticle, and bulk counterparts: (i) an unexpectedly high activity and selectivity by their unsaturated coordination sites and tunable electronic structures; (ii) a significant reduction in catalytic metal usage by maximizing the number of catalytic sites; and (iii) well-defined active sites for mechanistic studies. Previous studies on heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts have suggested that earth-abundant Co is a promising catalytic "
