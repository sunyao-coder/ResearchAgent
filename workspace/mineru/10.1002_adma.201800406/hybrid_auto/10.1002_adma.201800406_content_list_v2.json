Due to the relatively sluggish reaction kinetics, catalysts are necessary to generate high power output. The most common catalyst for this reaction is platinum, but its scarcity and derived high price have raised the search for abundant nonprecious metal catalysts. Inspired from enzymatic processes which are known to catalyze oxygen reduction reaction efficiently, employing transition metal complexes as their catalytic centers, many are working on the development of bioinspired and biomimetic catalysts of this class. This research news article gives a glimpse of the recent progress on the development of bioinspired molecular catalyst for oxygen reduction, highlighting the importance of the molecular structure of the catalysts, from advancements in porphyrins and phthalocyanines to the most recent work on corroles, and 3D networks such as metal–organic frameworks and polymeric networks, all with nonpyrolyzed, well-defined molecular catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction.

In recent years, in order to further improve the ORR catalytic activity of porphyrins and phthalocyanines, new paths have been taken in order to take advantage of the macrocyclic compound’s unique properties such as bonding the metal center through a 5th axial ligand position to solid substrates,[23–29] to mimic the behavior of hemecontaining enzymes as illustrated in Figure 1. For example, Liu et al. demonstrated that when grafting an imidazole-coordinated Fe-2,6-difluorotetraphenylporphyrin (Fe-DFTPP) onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the ORR activity of the porphyrin increases significantly, and surpasses that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, by measuring half-wave potentials as high as 0.88 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

Although their name is derived from the corrin molecule, found in vitamin B12, corroles are synthetic aromatic molecules that share many similarities to porphyrins, lacking but one carbon atom in the meso position of the surrounding ring (Figure 4). The corrole acts as a trianionic ligand, unlike corrins and porphyrins, which are monoanionic and dianionic ligands, respectively. This, among others, stabilizes the metal center and is prone to make the complex more stable, especially in acidic environment. Compared to other macrocyclic complexes, corroles tend to have higher formal metal ion oxidation states due to a smaller cavity of the ring and the greater density of negative charge in the trianionic core, which gives them several advantages over other molecular catalysts for ORR.[52–54] "

Till recent years, the synthesis of corroles has been an obstacle in their utilization, but since the development of simpler synthesis methods,[55] there has been an immediate increase in the use of these macrocycles for a wide array of applications. One of the first studies on the performance of corroles as catalysts for ORR was first published by Kadish et al.[54] In this work, they compared three systems of Co(III) corroles—monocorrole, biscorroles, and porphyrin-corrole dyads. It was then understood that one reduction active center is enough to catalyze the ORR and a great effort has been made since then in improving the (mono)corroles. There are three main degrees of freedom that can be modulated in the corrole’s structure in order to improve its catalytic performance: (1) the metal center, (2) the substituents on the corrole’s beta position, and (3) the substituents on the meso position. Mahammed and Gross recently published a detailed comparison of the catalytic performance of different corroles that were synthesized in recent years.[56] Various beta- and meso-substituted corroles were presented, from simple structures such as "

Another reasoning for this phenomenon is the flattening of the distorted molecular structure, which may result in making the metal-center more attractive to binding an oxygen molecule. "

There are still challenges that need to be overcome before their utilization, such as durability and reaction kinetics, both still considered lower than other groups of catalysts, but the progress made in recent years support their viability. The key parameters that seem to control the electrocatalysis of ORR with molecular catalysts are: (1) the metal center, (2) surface and ligand interactions, and (3) cooperativity/ synergistic effect between neighboring molecules. Molecular catalysts can also be used as model molecules for the PGM-free pyrolyzed catalyst group, which are very often more active and durable than their molecular precursors. The insight into the reaction mechanisms, effect of the metal center and substituents, and the interaction with different supports could shed light on the not-sowell-understood pyrolyzed transition metal complexes.
