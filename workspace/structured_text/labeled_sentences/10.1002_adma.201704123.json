        "C_0435": "Recently, ORR electrocatalyst research has been intensively explored with the strong motivation to obtain valuable solutions for economic and technological challenges faced by the fuel-cell industry."
    },
    {
        "C_0436": "Nevertheless, while hundreds of Pt-based electrocatalysts have been reported to outperform commercial $\\mathrm { P t / C }$ under the liquid half-cell condition, only limited cases of the electrocatalysts have been shown to be active or durable in the MEA of fuel-cell devices, which indicates a critical limitation in the current research field."
    },
    {
        "C_0437": "Another big issue of a large discrepancy in electrocatalytic activity occurs when electrocatalysts are applied to the MEA scale, especially in the case of intrinsically active electrocatalysts, as recently accentuated by Chorkendorff and co-workers.[132]"
    },
    {
        "C_0438": "This discrepancy might originate from the difference in the operating environment; unlike in a liquid half-cell test, a large amount of electrocatalyst is deposited with an ionomer on the polymer electrolyte membrane in MEA."
    },
    {
        "C_0439": "Due to the polymer electrolyte membrane and thick electrode configuration, electrocatalysts in MEA usually suffer from limited transport of protons and oxygen, as well as waterflooding within the cathodic electrode, which are usually neglected under the liquid half-cell condition."
    },
    {
        "C_0440": "However, there have been only a few efforts to correlate these different operating conditions with activity discrepancy."
    },
    {
        "C_0441": "Therefore, more systematic studies need to be organized to clarify the correlation between changes in operating conditions and electrocatalytic properties, which will set a milestone for bridging a large gap between liquid half-cell studies and MEA-based full-cell device application."
